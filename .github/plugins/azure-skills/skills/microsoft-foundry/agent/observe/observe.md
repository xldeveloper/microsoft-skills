# Agent Observability Loop

Orchestrate the full eval-driven optimization cycle for a Foundry agent. This skill manages the **multi-step workflow** — auto-creating evaluators, generating test datasets, running batch evals, clustering failures, optimizing prompts, redeploying, and comparing versions. Use this skill instead of calling individual foundry-mcp evaluation tools manually.

## When to Use This Skill

USE FOR: evaluate my agent, run an eval, test my agent, check agent quality, run batch evaluation, analyze eval results, why did my eval fail, cluster failures, improve agent quality, optimize agent prompt, compare agent versions, re-evaluate after changes, set up CI/CD evals, agent monitoring, eval-driven optimization.

> ⚠️ **DO NOT manually call** `evaluation_agent_batch_eval_create`, `evaluator_catalog_create`, `evaluation_comparison_create`, or `prompt_optimize` **without reading this skill first.** This skill defines required pre-checks, artifact persistence, and multi-step orchestration that the raw tools do not enforce.

## Quick Reference

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| MCP server | `foundry-mcp` |
| Key MCP tools | `evaluation_agent_batch_eval_create`, `evaluator_catalog_create`, `evaluation_comparison_create`, `prompt_optimize`, `agent_update` |
| Prerequisite | Agent deployed and running (use [deploy skill](../deploy/deploy.md)) |

## Entry Points

| User Intent | Start At |
|-------------|----------|
| "Deploy and evaluate my agent" | [Step 1: Auto-Setup Evaluators](references/deploy-and-setup.md) (deploy first via [deploy skill](../deploy/deploy.md)) |
| "Agent just deployed" / "Set up evaluation" | [Step 1: Auto-Setup Evaluators](references/deploy-and-setup.md) (skip deploy, run auto-create) |
| "Evaluate my agent" / "Run an eval" | [Step 1: Auto-Setup Evaluators](references/deploy-and-setup.md) first if `evaluators/` is empty, then [Step 2: Evaluate](references/evaluate-step.md) |
| "Why did my eval fail?" / "Analyze results" | [Step 3: Analyze](references/analyze-results.md) |
| "Improve my agent" / "Optimize prompt" | [Step 4: Optimize](references/optimize-deploy.md) |
| "Compare agent versions" | [Step 5: Compare](references/compare-iterate.md) |
| "Set up CI/CD evals" | [Step 6: CI/CD](references/cicd-monitoring.md) |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Before running any evaluation (Step 2), always check if evaluators and test datasets exist in `evaluators/` and `datasets/`. If they don't, route through [Step 1: Auto-Setup](references/deploy-and-setup.md) first — even if the user only asked to "evaluate."

## Before Starting — Detect Current State

1. Check `.env` for `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `AZURE_AI_AGENT_NAME`
2. Use `agent_get` and `agent_container_status_get` to verify the agent exists and is running
3. Use `evaluation_get` to check for existing eval runs
4. Jump to the appropriate entry point

## Loop Overview

```
1. Auto-setup evaluators & local test dataset
   → ask: "Run an evaluation to identify optimization opportunities?"
2. Evaluate (batch eval run)
3. Download & cluster failures
4. Pick a category to optimize
5. Optimize prompt
6. Deploy new version (after user sign-off)
7. Re-evaluate (same eval group)
8. Compare versions → decide which to keep
9. Loop to next category or finish
10. Prompt: enable CI/CD evals & continuous production monitoring
```

## Behavioral Rules

1. **Auto-poll in background.** After creating eval runs or starting containers, poll in a background terminal. Only surface the final result.
2. **Confirm before changes.** Show diff/summary before modifying agent code or deploying. Wait for sign-off.
3. **Prompt for next steps.** After each step, present options. Never assume the path forward.
4. **Write scripts to files.** Python scripts go in `scripts/` — no inline code blocks.
5. **Persist eval artifacts.** Save to `evaluators/`, `datasets/`, and `results/` for version tracking (see [deploy-and-setup](references/deploy-and-setup.md) for structure).
